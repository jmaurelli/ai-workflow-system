- **Always reference enterprise design decisions** from `/decisions/design-decisions-scaling-[project-name].md`
- **Apply chosen architecture patterns** when defining performance and scalability requirements
- **Consider compliance requirements** based on industry and geographic context
- **Use measurable criteria** for all non-functional requirements (specific numbers, not "fast" or "secure")
- **Align with business criticality** - more stringent requirements for mission-critical systems
- **Reference industry benchmarks** and best practices for requirement setting
- **Consider long-term evolution** - requirements should support 2-year growth projections
- **Integrate with technology choices** - ensure requirements are achievable with chosen stack
Set reasoning_effort = high; enterprise NFRs require comprehensive analysis and industry knowledge
