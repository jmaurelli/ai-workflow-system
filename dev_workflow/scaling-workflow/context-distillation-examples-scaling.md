# Enterprise Context Distillation Examples (Scaling)

## Objective
Provide concrete examples of how to distill complex enterprise workflow context into actionable, concise task file content that enables effective AI implementation of large-scale systems without context window exhaustion.

## Enterprise Context Distillation Patterns

### **System Architecture Distillation Pattern**
```
Raw: "We have chosen a microservices architecture with event sourcing and CQRS patterns. The system will use an API Gateway (Kong) for routing and authentication. Inter-service communication will use a service mesh (Istio) for security and observability. We'll implement distributed tracing using Jaeger for debugging across services..."

Distilled: "Microservices with CQRS + Event Sourcing, API Gateway (Kong), service mesh (Istio), distributed tracing (Jaeger)"
```

### **Enterprise Performance Budgets Pattern**
```
Raw: "The system must maintain 99.9% uptime which allows for maximum 8.77 hours of downtime per year. API response times must be under 100ms for the 95th percentile. The system should support 100,000+ concurrent users during peak loads. Page load times should be under 2 seconds..."

Distilled: "99.9% uptime (≤8.77 hrs/year), <100ms API response (95th percentile), 100K+ concurrent users, <2sec page load"
```

### **Security & Compliance Pattern**
```
Raw: "The system must achieve SOC2 Type II compliance and GDPR compliance for European users. Authentication will use OAuth 2.0 with service-to-service communication secured via mTLS. Key management will use Hardware Security Modules (HSM). All access must be logged and retained for 7 years for audit purposes..."

Distilled: "SOC2 Type II + GDPR compliance, OAuth 2.0 + mTLS service auth, HSM key management, audit logging (7-year retention)"
```

### **Design System Strategy Pattern**
```
Raw: "We will implement a federated design system that supports React, Vue, and Angular. Components will be built using atomic design methodology. Design tokens will be generated from Figma and distributed as JSON files to each platform. Governance will be managed through an RFC process overseen by the Design Council..."

Distilled: "Federated component library (React + Vue), design token pipeline (Figma → JSON → platform), governance via RFC process"
```

### **Team Coordination Pattern**
```
Raw: "Development is organized across 6 teams: 3 backend service teams, 2 frontend application teams, and 1 platform infrastructure team. Architectural decisions are made through an asynchronous RFC process. All teams participate in a shared architecture review board that meets weekly..."

Distilled: "6 teams (3 backend, 2 frontend, 1 platform), async RFC decision process, shared architecture review board"
```

## Enterprise Context Reference Mapping Patterns

### **Architecture-Specific References**
```
Good: `/decisions/design-decisions-scaling-users.md` microservices boundaries (section 2.1), CQRS patterns (section 3.2)
Avoid: `/decisions/design-decisions-scaling-users.md` architecture decisions (too broad)
```

### **Compliance Requirement Clusters**
```
Good: `/srs/srs-scaling-users.md` REQ-SEC-001 to REQ-SEC-030, GDPR compliance (section 4.2), SOC2 controls (section 4.3)
Avoid: `/srs/srs-scaling-users.md` security requirements (too vague for enterprise)
```

### **Performance Requirement Ranges**
```
Good: `/srs/srs-scaling-users.md` REQ-PERF-001 to REQ-PERF-015, REQ-SCALE-001 to REQ-SCALE-020
Avoid: `/srs/srs-scaling-users.md` performance requirements (too broad for enterprise scale)
```

## Enterprise Task Context Embedding Guidelines

### **Parent Task Context - Enterprise Architecture Information**
Include:
- **Architecture pattern** (microservice pattern, distributed system pattern, design system pattern)
- **Enterprise constraints** (performance targets, compliance requirements, availability targets)
- **Integration patterns** (service mesh, API gateway, component federation, team coordination)
- **Quality requirements** (security compliance, accessibility standards, performance budgets)

Example:
```
- [ ] 1.0 Implement User Service Microservice
  - **Context**: .NET Core service, CQRS pattern, PostgreSQL cluster, OAuth 2.0 auth, 99.9% uptime target, team coordination via UserService-RFC-024
```

### **Subtask Context - Specific Enterprise Implementation Information**
Include:
- **Specific pattern** (CQRS command handler, service mesh integration, design token usage)
- **Enterprise targets** (specific performance metrics, compliance requirements, quality gates)
- **Integration specifics** (service communication, component API, team handoffs)

Example:
```
- [ ] 1.2 Implement command handlers - CQRS command side, <50ms command processing, audit event generation
- [ ] 1.3 Implement query handlers - CQRS query side, read replicas, <100ms query response, caching layer integration
```

## Enterprise Context Window Management Strategy

### **What Goes in Executive Context (Always Loaded for Enterprise)**
- **System architecture patterns** with specific technology choices
- **Enterprise performance budgets** that affect all implementation decisions
- **Security and compliance requirements** that guide all development
- **Design system strategy** that affects component and interface development
- **Team coordination patterns** that affect cross-functional implementation

### **What Goes in Context References (Load as Needed for Enterprise)**
- **Detailed architectural decisions** with rationale and trade-offs
- **Specific NFR clusters** with full specification details and acceptance criteria
- **Component library governance** with detailed processes and standards
- **Team capability matrices** with skill development and coordination protocols

### **What Goes in Task Context (Minimal per Enterprise Task)**
- **Architecture pattern** for the specific service or component
- **Enterprise constraints** that affect implementation (performance, security, compliance)
- **Integration approach** for connecting with enterprise systems and teams
- **Quality requirements** specific to the task (accessibility, performance, security)

## Example 3: Enterprise API Gateway Implementation

### **Distilled Executive Context**
```markdown
## Executive Context (Enterprise-Distilled for AI Agents)
**System Architecture**: Kong API Gateway with plugin architecture, rate limiting (10K req/min), circuit breakers, service discovery (Consul)
**Technology Evolution**: Direct service calls → API Gateway pattern, basic auth → OAuth 2.0 + JWT, manual scaling → auto-scaling (K8s HPA)
**Design System Strategy**: API design standards (OpenAPI 3.0), consistent error responses, pagination patterns, versioning strategy (header-based)
**Performance Budgets**: <50ms gateway latency, 99.95% availability, 500K+ requests/sec throughput, <1sec timeout handling
**Security & Compliance**: OAuth 2.0 + OIDC integration, rate limiting per client, DDoS protection, audit logging (all requests), CORS policies
**Team Coordination**: Platform team owns gateway, service teams define routes, security team defines policies, 24/7 on-call rotation
```

### **Enterprise Task Context Example**
```markdown
## Tasks (Enterprise Context-Embedded)
- [ ] 3.0 Implement Kong API Gateway Configuration
  - **Context**: Kong cluster (3 nodes), Consul service discovery, OAuth 2.0 plugin, <50ms latency target, 99.95% availability requirement
  - [ ] 3.1 Setup Kong cluster - Docker Swarm deployment, PostgreSQL backend, load balancer configuration, health checks
  - [ ] 3.2 Configure service discovery - Consul integration, service registration, health monitoring, automatic failover
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement authentication plugin - OAuth 2.0 + JWT validation, token introspection, rate limiting per client
  - [ ] 3.4 Setup monitoring - Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules, SLA tracking
```

This enterprise-level context distillation enables AI agents to implement complex distributed systems with proper architecture, performance, security, and team coordination considerations while managing context efficiently.
