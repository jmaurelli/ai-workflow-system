# Software Project Workflow Guide (Scaling)

## Objective
Enforce rigor and traceability in the workflow, while keeping docs manageable for a solo developer.  

---

## Scaling Workflow
1. Idea → Full PRD (`create-prd-scaling.md`).  
2. PRD → Detailed tasks + TDD (`tasks-and-testing-scaling.md`).  
3. Tasks → Code with full tests.  
4. Deploy → Use full deployment plan (`project-templates-scaling.md`).  
5. Maintain → Monitor, log, iterate.  
6. Record test results (`test-suite-scaling.md`).  

---

## AI Agent Instructions
- Default to **Scaling workflow** here.  
- Do not compress detail.  
- Maintain strict links between PRD → Tasks → Tests → Results.
