# TDD with Design Principles (Scaling)

## Objective
Follow strict TDD with clear design guidelines.  
Every coding step should start with a failing test.

---

## Workflow
1. Write failing test.  
2. Implement minimal code to pass.  
3. Refactor to clean design.  
4. Add edge cases.  

---

## Design Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle.  
- Keep functions small and composable.  
- Refactor aggressively.  

---

## AI Agent Instructions
- Always write tests before code.  
- Require test coverage notes.  
- Refactor suggestions should be generated alongside tests.
