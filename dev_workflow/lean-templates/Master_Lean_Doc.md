# BRD Template

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview

- **One-liner Goal (Why does this exist?):**  

## 2. Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?  

## 3. Business Objectives
- [ ] Objective 1  
- [ ] Objective 2  

## 4. Success Criteria (MVP)
- What does "success" look like for the MVP?  

## 5. Stakeholders (even if just you)
- Primary:  
- Secondary:  

## 6. Constraints & Risks
- Constraints (time, budget, tech):  
- Risks:

*Keep it short. The BRD is your compass: why this project matters.*

# PRD Template

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Summary
- **What is the product? (1-2 sentences)**  

## 2. Target Users
- Who will use this product?  

## 3. Key Features (MVP First)
- [ ] Feature 1  
- [ ] Feature 2  
- [ ] Feature 3  

## 4. User Stories
- As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit].  

## 5. Prioritization
- Must Have:  
- Nice to Have:  

## 6. Assumptions
- List assumptions (technical, user, business).  

---
*PRD is your "what to build." Focus on MVP scope first.*

# SRS Template

# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. System Overview
- What system are you building?  

## 2. Functional Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1  
- [ ] Requirement 2  

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance:  
- Security:  
- Scalability:  

## 4. System Architecture (high level)
- Diagram/sketch if useful (optional).  

## 5. Data & APIs
- Inputs:  
- Outputs:  
- External APIs:  

## 6. Constraints
- Tech stack limitations, libraries, hosting.  

---
*SRS is the "how it works" guide. Don’t over-engineer — focus on what’s critical for MVP.*

# TDD Template

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Plan

## 1. Scope of Testing (MVP Features)
- Feature 1 → What to test?  
- Feature 2 → What to test?  

## 2. Test Cases (Lean Format)
- **Given** [context]  
- **When** [action]  
- **Then** [expected result]  

Example:  
- Given a user enters valid credentials  
- When they click login  
- Then they should see the dashboard  

## 3. Automation Strategy
- Which tests will I automate?  
- Which will I test manually (for speed)?  

## 4. Tools
- Unit tests: (e.g., Jest, Pytest, etc.)  
- Integration tests:  

---
*TDD doc is your safety net. Keep it lean: just enough test coverage to not break MVP progress.*
