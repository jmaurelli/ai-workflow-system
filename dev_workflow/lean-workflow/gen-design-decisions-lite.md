- **Frontend Technologies**: [ ] (1=New, 5=Expert)  
- **Database Design**: [ ] (1=New, 5=Expert)
- **UX/UI Design**: [ ] (1=New, 5=Expert)
- **API Design**: [ ] (1=New, 5=Expert)

## Project Context
- **Project Type**: [Web App|Mobile App|API|Desktop App|Other]

```

### 2. Core Technology Stack Decisions

#### **Interactive Questionnaire: Backend Technology**

**Question Set A: Project Requirements & NFR Constraints**
1. **Primary functionality** of your backend:
   - [ ] **Simple CRUD operations** → *Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express recommended*
   - [ ] **High-performance processing** → *Go or Rust recommended*
   - [ ] **Data-heavy analytics** → *Python recommended*
   - [ ] **Real-time features** → *Node.js or Go recommended*

2. **Performance requirements from SRS**:
   - [ ] **Response time < 100ms** → *Go, Rust, or optimized Node.js*
   - [ ] **Response time < 500ms** → *Python FastAPI, Node.js, Go*
   - [ ] **Response time < 2 seconds** → *Any technology with proper architecture*
   - [ ] **High concurrency (1000+ requests/sec)** → *Go, Node.js, or async Python*

3. **Security requirements from SRS**:
   - [ ] **Basic security (authentication, HTTPS)** → *Any modern framework*
   - [ ] **Enterprise security (OAuth, encryption)** → *Mature ecosystems: Python, Node.js, Java*
   - [ ] **Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2)** → *Well-audited: Python, Node.js, Java*

4. **Your learning preference**:
   - [ ] **Want to learn industry-standard** → *Python or JavaScript/TypeScript*
   - [ ] **Want maximum performance** → *Go or Rust*
   - [ ] **Want rapid prototyping** → *Python or Node.js*

5. **Deployment preference**:
   - [ ] **Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)** → *Python, Node.js, or Go*
   - [ ] **Simple hosting** → *Python or Node.js*
   - [ ] **Container deployment** → *Any language*

**Learning Notes**: *Backend choice affects development speed, performance, and learning curve. Consider SRS performance budgets when choosing - Go excels at low latency, Python at rapid development, Node.js at full-stack consistency. Security and compliance requirements may limit technology choices.*

1. **Action**: [e.g., "Search for items"]
   - **Component Needed**: [e.g., "Search bar with filters"]
   - **Design Pattern**: [e.g., "Search input + dropdown filters"]
   - **Learning Note**: [What makes this component effective]

2. **Action**: [e.g., "View item details"]
   - **Component Needed**: [e.g., "Detail card/modal"]
   - **Design Pattern**: [e.g., "Card layout with image + text"]
   - **Learning Note**: [Design principles for information hierarchy]

### Layout Structure
- **Header**: [Navigation, logo, user actions]
- **Main Content**: [Primary content area organization]
- **Sidebar** (if needed): [Secondary navigation or filters]
- **Footer**: [Links, contact, legal]

### Design System Approach
- [ ] **Use component library** (Material-UI, Chakra, Ant Design)
  - *Learning benefit: Proven patterns, accessibility built-in*
- [ ] **Custom design with CSS framework** (Tailwind, Bootstrap)
  - *Learning benefit: Understand design principles, more control*
- [ ] **Fully custom CSS**
  - *Learning benefit: Deep CSS knowledge, full control*

   - [ ] **Mixed users** → *Progressive disclosure, tooltips*
   - [ ] **Expert users** → *Keyboard shortcuts, dense information*

**Learning Notes**: *Good UX prioritizes user goals over features. Start with user tasks, then design interface to support those tasks efficiently.*

### 5. Integration & API Design

#### **Template: API Design Decisions**

```markdown
## API Design Framework

### API Style Decision
- [ ] **REST API** - *Good for CRUD operations, widely understood*
