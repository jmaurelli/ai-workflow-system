# Task Completion Feedback System

## Objective
Capture implementation insights from task completion to improve future design decisions, context distillation, and workflow effectiveness. Build a learning loop that makes each project better than the last.

---

## When to Use
- **After completing each parent task** - capture immediate implementation insights
- **After project completion** - comprehensive feedback and pattern recognition
- **Before starting new projects** - review lessons learned for better decisions
- **Quarterly reviews** - aggregate feedback for workflow improvements
