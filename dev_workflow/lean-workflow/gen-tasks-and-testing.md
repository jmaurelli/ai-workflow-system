Developer: # Workflow: Tasks + Testing (MVP-First)

## Objective
Transform a Lean PRD into actionable tasks with integrated testing guidance. This process combines task generation and lightweight TDD into a streamlined approach suitable for solo MVP development.


## Workflow Steps

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of intended sub-tasks before proceeding; keep checklist items conceptual.

### 1. Input
- Begin with a Lean PRD saved at `/prd/prd-[feature-name].md`.
- **Design Decisions (Required)**: Read design decisions from `/decisions/design-decisions-[feature-name].md` to understand:
  - **Tech Stack Choices**: Backend/frontend technologies, database, API style
  - **UX Approach**: Component library strategy, design patterns, user flow decisions
  - **Learning Context**: Knowledge confidence levels and learning goals
  - **Decision Rationale**: Why specific technologies and approaches were chosen
- If present, read Lean SRS at `/srs/srs-[feature-name].md` and incorporate NFR budgets into acceptance criteria (reference `NFR-*`).
- **Design Analysis**: If design analysis exists at `/design/design-[feature-name].md`, incorporate component reuse and integration guidance.
- **Integration Planning**: Use design analysis integration approach to plan task dependencies.
- **Component Reuse**: Reference design analysis for existing components to reuse vs. creating new ones.
- Ensure the PRD contains: overview, goals, user stories, and requirements.
- If any elements are missing, clearly state what is absent at the top of the output, and skip steps that cannot be performed as a result.
- Read `/docs/architecture.md` if present; otherwise, capture minimal architecture decisions inline and note any deltas or open items.

### 2. Generate Parent Tasks
- Identify 3–5 parent tasks derived from the PRD.
- If fewer than 3 or more than 5 parent tasks are available, proceed with what is supported, and clearly document this under **Notes** in the output.
- Parent tasks should be clear and high-level, for example: “Implement login API.”

### 3. Expand into Sub-Tasks (Design-Decision Aware)
- For each parent task, break it down into smaller sub-tasks (ideally actions that take less than one day) using Markdown checklists (`- [ ]`).
- **Apply Design Decisions**: Tailor sub-tasks to chosen tech stack (e.g., React components vs Vue components, Python FastAPI vs Node.js Express).
- **Incorporate Learning Goals**: Include sub-tasks that support skill development identified in design decisions.
- **Honor UX Decisions**: Structure frontend tasks according to chosen component library strategy and design patterns.
- Ensure that each parent task includes at least one sub-task related to testing.
- The first sub-task under each parent MUST be: "Write failing smoke test (targeting acceptance criteria)".
- Add explicit acceptance criteria for each parent task, tied to PRD requirements.

**Example:**
- Parent: Implement login API
  - [ ] Define request/response schema
  - [ ] Write failing smoke test (valid + invalid login)
  - [ ] Implement minimal code to pass the test
  - [ ] Add error handling for bad input
  - [ ] Validate acceptance criteria (Req 2.1, 2.2)

### 4. Relevant Files (Tech-Stack Aware)
- List the files associated with each parent task in a dedicated **Relevant Files** section as a Markdown list.
- **Apply Tech Stack Decisions**: Use file extensions and paths matching chosen technologies:
  - **Backend**: `.py` for Python, `.js/.ts` for Node.js, `.go` for Go
  - **Frontend**: `.jsx/.tsx` for React, `.vue` for Vue.js, `.js/.ts` for vanilla
  - **Database**: `.sql` for relational, `.json` for document stores
- Always specify both implementation and related test files.
- Use a standard layout when applicable:
  - Implementation: `src/[area]/[name].[extension]`
  - Tests: `src/[area]/__tests__/[name].test.[extension]`
- Generate at least one test stub file per parent task (empty is acceptable) and include it.

### 5. Changelog
- Maintain a **Changelog** at the very top of the task file in Markdown format.
- Record each change as a new bullet point, starting with `[YYYY-MM-DD]`.
 - Reference test validation per `process-tasks.md` and `dev-utils/test/schema.json`.

## Testing Guidelines (MVP-First)

### MVP Mode
- Write only smoke tests for key flows:
  - App startup
  - User login
  - Main feature operation
- Place test stubs alongside code, even if mostly empty.
- Execute tests per `process-tasks.md` (centralized commands, JSON schema, and cleanup rules). For Jest, use `--watch=false --watchAll=false`.

### TDD-Lite Mandate (MVP)
- Follow a lightweight RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for every parent task:
  - RED: Write a failing smoke test for the acceptance criteria first.
  - GREEN: Implement the minimal code needed to pass the test.
  - REFACTOR: Clean up names, remove duplication, and simplify logic.
- Do not add implementation code before authoring the failing smoke test.

### Enhancement Mode (Later)
- Gradually add more tests:
  - Expand smoke tests to unit tests, then integration tests.
  - Update tasks to include design-driven TDD approaches.
  - Ensure all test results conform to the schema in `test-suite.md`.

## AI Agent Instructions (Context-Aware Task Generation)

### Context Distillation (Priority 1)
- **Always read and distill** the following sources into Executive Context:
  - `/decisions/design-decisions-[feature-name].md` → Tech stack rationale
  - `/srs/srs-[feature-name].md` → Performance budgets and security baseline
  - `/design/design-[feature-name].md` → Component strategy and integration approach
  - `/decisions/learning-notes-[feature-name].md` → Team confidence and learning goals
- **Distill into concise bullets** - each Executive Context item should be 1-2 lines maximum
- **Focus on implementation-critical info** - what AI agents need to make good coding decisions

### Context Reference Mapping (Priority 2)
- **Map specific task needs** to exact document sections for just-in-time loading
- **Example**: "For JWT implementation → `/srs/srs-auth.md` REQ-SEC-002, REQ-PERF-003"
- **Be specific**: Section numbers, requirement IDs, decision rationale sections

### Task Context Embedding (Priority 3)
- **Each parent task gets essential context** - tech pattern, key constraints, integration points
- **Each subtask gets minimal context** - specific pattern, performance target, or security requirement
- **Balance completeness vs brevity** - enough context for AI to implement correctly, not more

### Smart Context Management
- **Avoid context duplication** - reference don't repeat detailed requirements
- **Use shorthand for common patterns** - "FastAPI middleware pattern", "React component reuse"
- **Flag high-context tasks** - when tasks need extensive external context, note it clearly

### Technical Implementation Rules
- **Apply tech stack choices** to all file extensions, frameworks, and patterns
- **Honor UX decisions** when structuring frontend tasks and component organization
- **Include NFR validation** in acceptance criteria with specific metrics
- **Reference decision rationale** when explaining why specific approaches are chosen
- Always generate both the task list and test stubs together.
- For MVP, restrict tests to smoke tests only.
- Save task files in `/tasks/tasks-[feature-name].md`, using the lowercase, kebab-case slug.
- Output should fit on a single page for MVP; expand only if Enhancement Mode is explicitly requested.
- If instructions cannot be followed due to missing PRD data, provide a clear note in the output and indicate incomplete or omitted sections as appropriate.

 

Set reasoning_effort = medium due to moderate task complexity; produce tool and code outputs succinctly, but offer fuller detail in the final Markdown document.

After generating the Markdown task file, validate that all required sections (Changelog, Relevant Files, Notes if needed, Tasks) are present and in the correct order, that every parent task contains at least one test-related sub-task, that each parent task has acceptance criteria, and that listed test stub files exist or are scheduled to be created.

After generating the Markdown task file, validate that all required sections (Changelog, Relevant Files, Notes if needed, Tasks) are present and in the correct order, and that every parent task contains at least one test-related sub-task. If any step is incomplete due to missing PRD data, clearly indicate this in both the Notes and Tasks sections.

## Handoff + Memory Sync
Update agent memory with the following minimal context:

```json
{
  "stage": "tasks",
  "feature_slug": "[feature-name]",
  "prd_path": "/prd/prd-[feature-name].md",
  "srs_path": "/srs/srs-[feature-name].md",
  "parent_tasks": ["..."],
  "acceptance_criteria_by_task": {"1.0": ["..."], "2.0": ["..."]},
  "relevant_files_by_task": {"1.0": ["src/..."], "2.0": ["src/..."]},
  "test_stub_paths": ["src/.../__tests__/...test.ts"],
  "traceability_map": {"REQ-1": ["1.0"], "REQ-2": ["2.0"]},
  "nfr_traceability": {"NFR-1": ["1.0", "3.4"], "NFR-2": ["2.0"]},
  "nfr_budgets": {"latency_p50_ms": 300, "latency_p95_ms": 800, "error_rate": 0.01}
}
```

### Artifact Manifest Update
- Append or create `/artifacts/manifest.json` with the same keys, plus timestamp.

 

### Context Seed (for next stage)
Provide this block to the next stage:

```json
{
  "feature_slug": "[feature-name]",
  "tasks_path": "/tasks/tasks-[feature-name].md",
  "test_stub_paths": ["src/.../__tests__/...test.ts"]
}
```
