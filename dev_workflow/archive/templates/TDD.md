# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Plan

## 1. Scope of Testing (MVP Features)
- Feature 1 → What to test?  
- Feature 2 → What to test?  

## 2. Test Cases (Lean Format)
- **Given** [context]  
- **When** [action]  
- **Then** [expected result]  

Example:  
- Given a user enters valid credentials  
- When they click login  
- Then they should see the dashboard  

## 3. Automation Strategy
- Which tests will I automate?  
- Which will I test manually (for speed)?  

## 4. Tools
- Unit tests: (e.g., Jest, Pytest, etc.)  
- Integration tests:

*TDD doc is your safety net. Keep it lean: just enough test coverage to not break MVP progress.*
