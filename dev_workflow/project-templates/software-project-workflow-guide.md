## MVP Mode Workflow
1. Start with an idea, create `create-prd.md` for a lean PRD.
2. Use `generate-tasks.md` to produce the task file from the PRD.
3. Complete tasks with code and minimal smoke tests.
4. Deploy quickly.

---

## Enhancement Mode Workflow
1. Expand lean PRD into a full PRD.
2. Expand tasks into full TDD tasks.
3. Run a complete test suite.
4. Perform formal deployment and monitoring.
