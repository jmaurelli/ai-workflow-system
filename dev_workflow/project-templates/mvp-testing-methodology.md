# üîπ MVP Testing Methodology: Establishing a Foundation

The primary objective during the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** phase is to build a core, functional product quickly to gather market feedback.  
The testing strategy is focused on **high-speed feedback loops** and ensuring the fundamental building blocks are robust.

## 1. Testing Types and Their Purpose

### Function/Method Tests
- **Definition:** The most granular and fundamental tests. Written to verify that a single function, method, or small block of code works as expected.  
- **Characteristics:** Highly isolated, fast to run, and executed continuously during development.  
- **Effect:** Catch bugs as soon as they are introduced, preventing propagation. This results in a more stable codebase and reduces debugging time/effort.  

### Logic Tests
- **Definition:** Validate the **core business logic**. Ensure complex algorithms, conditional statements, and data processing rules are correct.  
- **Effect:** Guarantee the integrity of the application's **business rules** (the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù). Catching and fixing logic errors early prevents compounding issues.

## 2. Relationship Between Function and Logic Tests

Function/Method Tests and Logic Tests are **complementary, not mutually exclusive**. Both are essential for a robust MVP testing strategy.

- **Function/Method Tests ‚Üí Focus on Correctness**  
  Confirm that a specific piece of code behaves exactly as it should in isolation.  
  *Example:* A test for `add(a, b)` ensures that `add(2, 3)` consistently returns `5`.

- **Logic Tests ‚Üí Focus on Validity**  
  Ensure the code is implementing the intended business rules.  
  *Example:* A test for `calculate_discount(order)` ensures that the business rule of giving a 10% discount on orders over $100 is applied correctly.

**Together, they form a comprehensive safety net:**  
- Function tests ensure **individual components** are correct.  
- Logic tests ensure those components **work together to fulfill business requirements**.  
- Both are **non-optional** in professional software development.

## 3. MVP Phase Testing Philosophy

- Use **Function and Logic Tests heavily** for immediate bug detection and validation of business rules.  
- Use **Module or Integration Tests sparingly** to keep development lean and feedback fast.  
- Focus on **speed and correctness** over exhaustive coverage during MVP.  
- Transition to deeper testing (integration, E2E, performance) **post-MVP** once adoption justifies it.

## 4. Success Criteria for MVP Testing
- Bugs caught early at the function/logic level.  
- Core business rules validated continuously.  
- Minimal reliance on heavy integration tests during MVP.  
- Fast, repeatable test runs to support rapid iteration.
