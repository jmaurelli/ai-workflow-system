Developer: # Test Suite Workflow (MVP-First)

## Role and Objective
- Define a minimal test suite workflow to validate core functionality and lay the groundwork for future test enhancements.

## Checklist
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do prior to implementation; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

## Instructions
- Implement only essential smoke tests for the MVP phase.
- Save all test results to the `/tests/results/` directory.
- Record test outcomes using simple ✅/❌ status indicators.
- Always generate a results file, even for smoke tests; use the default lightweight JSON schema shown below.
- After each test is run and result is saved, validate the correctness of the result file in 1-2 lines and confirm successful creation; if validation fails, self-correct as needed.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or overengineering during the MVP stage.

## Test Result Example
```json
{
  "test": "App starts",
  "result": "✅",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Enhancement Path
- Plan to augment the result schema over time, including more detailed TDD metadata (e.g., test coverage, duration, log output).
- Introduce and rigorously enforce a comprehensive `test-suite.md` schema in future development stages.

---

## Output Format
- Use the provided lightweight JSON structure for MVP-stage test results.
- Store results in `/tests/results/` as individual files.

## Stop Conditions
- Consider the test suite implementation complete for the MVP phase once core functionality is verified and appropriately logged.

## Persistence
- Maintain result logging for all future testing phases as the schema evolves, ensuring full traceability and compliance with future test-suite requirements.
