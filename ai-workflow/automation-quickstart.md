# 🚀 Python Workflow System - Complete MVP & Feature Automation

## **🎯 Two Clear Workflows: MVP Creation vs Feature Addition**

*🎉 Revolutionary Update: Python-based system with clear separation between MVP projects and feature additions!*

## **🤖 LATEST REVOLUTION: REAL LLM CONTENT GENERATION + ORGANIZED PROJECT STRUCTURE!**

**🚀 ALL AUTOMATION MODES NOW SUPPORT REAL LLM API INTEGRATION WITH ORGANIZED PROJECT MANAGEMENT!**

### **🚀 For NEW MVP Projects:**
```bash
# Create complete MVP project with real content generation
./mvp-initializer.py --project=task-manager-app --mode=autonomous --llm-api

# Creates organized project in /projects/task-manager-app/
# Generates complete MVP specification with real PRD, SRS, tasks
```

### **➕ For FEATURES in Existing Projects:**
```bash
# Add features to existing MVP projects
./workflow-runner.py --feature=user-authentication --existing-project=task-manager-app --mode=autonomous --llm-api

# Adds feature to existing project with full context awareness
```

### **🔧 For STANDALONE Features (Legacy):**
```bash
# Create standalone features (legacy mode)
./workflow-runner.py --feature=standalone-component --mode=autonomous --llm-api
```

### **🌟 Choose Your LLM Provider:**
```bash
--llm-provider=openai      # GPT-3.5/GPT-4 (default)
--llm-provider=anthropic   # Claude 3.5 Sonnet  
--llm-provider=google      # Google Gemini
--llm-provider=local_ollama # Free local models
--llm-provider=groq        # Ultra-fast inference
```

**📖 Complete setup guide:** [llm-api-setup-guide.md](llm-api-setup-guide.md)

### **🚪 Option 1: GUIDED Mode (Maximum Oversight + Real Execution)**
*Maximum human oversight with real file generation - stops at every major decision point*

```bash
# 🚀 NEW MVP: Create complete project with guided oversight
./mvp-initializer.py --project=task-manager --mode=guided --llm-api
# ✅ CREATES: /projects/task-manager/ with complete MVP specification!

# ➕ ADD FEATURE: Add feature to existing project with oversight
./workflow-runner.py --feature=user-auth --existing-project=task-manager --mode=guided --llm-api
# ✅ CREATES: Feature documentation within existing project structure!

# 🧪 DRY RUN: See execution plan before running
./mvp-initializer.py --project=my-app --mode=guided --llm-api --dry-run
./workflow-runner.py --feature=dashboard --existing-project=my-app --mode=guided --llm-api --dry-run
# ✅ SHOWS: What will be created and where
```

**Best for**: First-time users, critical features, learning the workflow

**🎯 What Actually Happens:**
- **🚀 MVP**: Creates `/projects/task-manager/` with organized structure
- **➕ Feature**: Adds feature documentation to existing project
- Generates `project-manifest.json` with execution tracking  
- Creates AI execution instructions for each workflow step (01-output.md → 09-output.md)
- **🚀 WITH --llm-api: Generates REAL PRD, SRS, tasks content automatically!**
- **📁 Organized**: All related documents in single project directory

---

### **⚡ Option 2: AUTONOMOUS Mode (AI-Driven + Real File Generation)**  
*Minimal human oversight with real execution - AI agent runs automatically with smart safety checks*

```bash
# ACTUALLY RUN workflow automatically with minimal gates
./workflow-orchestrator.sh --mode=autonomous --feature=dashboard
# ✅ CREATES: /features/2025-01-15-dashboard/ with real files and minimal gates!

# AI-powered REAL EXECUTION with risk assessment
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=autonomous --feature=api-v2
# ✅ RESULT: Complete feature directory with intelligent gate decisions!

# See what autonomous mode will actually create
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=autonomous --feature=quick-prototype --dry-run
# ✅ PREVIEW: Execution plan showing real file generation with minimal gates
```

**Best for**: Experienced users, incremental features, rapid prototyping

**🎯 What Actually Happens:**
- Creates feature directory with auto-generated date prefix
- Executes most workflow steps automatically (only stops for destructive actions)
- Generates real AI execution instructions with embedded context
- Creates working feature structure ready for development

---

### **🧠 Option 3: LEARNING Mode (Adaptive + Real Intelligence)**
*Learns from your approval patterns and reduces gates over time while creating real files*

```bash
# ACTUALLY RUN adaptive workflow that learns your preferences
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=learning --feature=search-engine
# ✅ CREATES: /features/2025-01-15-search-engine/ with adaptive gate decisions!

# See how the learning algorithm plans your REAL execution
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=learning --feature=payments --dry-run
# ✅ PREVIEW: Shows adaptive gates based on your approval history

# ACTUALLY EXECUTE with organizational learning
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=learning --feature=complex-system
# ✅ RESULT: Creates feature directory with intelligent gate reduction over time!
```

**Best for**: Power users, consistent workflow patterns, organizational learning

**🎯 What Actually Happens:**
- Creates feature directory with intelligent gate decisions based on history
- Learns your approval patterns and reduces gates for trusted workflows
- Generates real execution instructions with adaptive context
- Builds organizational workflow intelligence over time
- Always maintains safety gates for high-risk operations

## **🎛️ Custom Gate Configuration + Real Execution**

### **Skip Specific Gates (With Real File Creation)**
```bash
# ACTUALLY RUN while skipping design analysis and completion summary gates
./workflow-orchestrator.sh --mode=autonomous --feature=notifications \
    --skip-gates=design_analysis,completion_summary
# ✅ CREATES: /features/2025-01-15-notifications/ with custom gate configuration!
```

### **Force Specific Gates (With Real Execution)**
```bash
# ACTUALLY RUN while requiring human approval for critical steps
./workflow-orchestrator.sh --mode=autonomous --feature=payments \
    --require-gates=task_implementation,design_decisions
# ✅ CREATES: /features/2025-01-15-payments/ with enhanced safety gates!
```

### **Dry Run + Real Execution Preview**
```bash
# See REAL execution plan without actually creating files
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=autonomous --feature=test-feature \
    --dry-run --verbose
# ✅ PREVIEW: Shows exactly what files and directories will be created

# Then ACTUALLY RUN the same configuration
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=autonomous --feature=test-feature --verbose
# ✅ CREATES: The previewed feature directory with real files!
```

# ✅ CREATES: /features/2025-01-15-e-commerce-platform/ with AI instructions

# STEP 2: Process AI execution instructions  
./ai-agent-integration.py process features/2025-01-15-e-commerce-platform/
# ✅ SHOWS: AI agent guidance and execution steps

# STEP 3: AI agent (like ChatGPT) executes workflow steps
# - Read AI execution instructions in XX-output.md files
# - Follow structured workflow document guidance
# - Generate required outputs (PRD, SRS, tasks, etc.)

# STEP 4: Mark workflow steps as completed
./ai-agent-integration.py complete features/2025-01-15-e-commerce-platform/01-output.md --success
# ✅ TRACKS: Completion status and validation
```

### **🔄 Complete AI Agent Workflow**

```bash
# Feature Directory Structure Created:
/features/2025-01-15-e-commerce-platform/
├── 📄 feature-manifest.json          ← Execution tracking
├── 📄 01-output.md                   ← AI instructions for mvp-entrypoint
├── 📄 02-output.md                   ← AI instructions for gen-prd
├── 📄 03-output.md                   ← AI instructions for gen-srs
