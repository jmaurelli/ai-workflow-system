# Workflow: Generate Project History & Quarterly Rollups

## Objective
Create organized project history by aggregating completed features into quarterly summaries, capturing architectural evolution, learning progression, and strategic insights for organizational knowledge management and future project planning.

---

## When to Use
- **End of quarter**: Generate comprehensive Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 rollup summaries
- **Project retrospectives**: Before major architecture changes or technology shifts
- **Knowledge transfer**: When onboarding new team members or sharing learnings
- **Strategic planning**: When planning next quarter's architecture and technology choices

## Workflow (Quarterly History Generation)

### **1. Identify Completed Features**
```bash
# Auto-scan for completed features
find /features -name "feature-manifest.json" -exec grep -l '"current_phase": "completed"' {} \; | \
while read manifest; do
  FEATURE_DIR=$(dirname "$manifest")
  FEATURE_NAME=$(jq -r '.feature_metadata.feature_name' "$manifest")
  echo "Completed feature: $FEATURE_NAME at $FEATURE_DIR"
done
```

### **2. Archive Completed Features**
```bash
# Move completed features to project history
QUARTER="2024-q1"
mkdir -p "/project-history/archived-features"

# Move each completed feature directory
for feature_dir in /features/*; do
  if [[ -f "$feature_dir/feature-manifest.json" ]]; then
    STATUS=$(jq -r '.workflow_status.current_phase' "$feature_dir/feature-manifest.json")
    if [[ "$STATUS" == "completed" ]]; then
      mv "$feature_dir" "/project-history/archived-features/"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### **3. Generate Quarterly Summary**
- **Read all completion summaries**: Extract key data from each `completion-summary.md`
- **Aggregate achievements**: Combine business value, technical achievements, learning outcomes
- **Analyze patterns**: Identify recurring architecture decisions, technology choices, process improvements
- **Generate rollup documents**: Create comprehensive quarterly summary with strategic insights
