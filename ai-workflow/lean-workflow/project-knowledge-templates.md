## 🎯 AI Discovery Optimization

### **Primary AI Entry Points:**
1. **project-index.json** → Global project intelligence
2. **feature-manifest.json** → Feature-specific context
3. **project-knowledge/** → Strategic and pattern knowledge

### **AI Navigation Pattern:**
```
AI Agent Workflow:
1. Check project-index.json for active features and components
2. Scan feature manifests for reusable exports and patterns
3. Reference project-knowledge for architectural constraints
4. Generate integration-aware solutions
```

## 📋 Template Initialization

**These templates are auto-populated during workflow execution:**

### **architecture/system-overview.md**
- Generated from: Initial discovery context + accumulated feature decisions
- Updated by: Each feature's architecture contributions
- AI Usage: High-level integration guidance

### **business-context/project-vision.md**
- Generated from: 01-mvp-entrypoint discovery context
- Updated by: Strategic pivots and goal evolution
- AI Usage: Feature prioritization and scope decisions

### **developer-knowledge/coding-patterns.md**
- Generated from: Accumulated design decisions across features
- Updated by: Each feature's reusable patterns
- AI Usage: Code generation and consistency enforcement

## 🔄 Lifecycle Integration

**Knowledge Promotion Flow:**
```
Feature Development → Knowledge Extraction → Project Knowledge Base
                  ↓                      ↓                    ↓
               tasks.md              design-decisions.md    coding-patterns.md
              artifacts/            integration-requirements  integration-cookbook.md
           completion-summary.md         api-endpoints.md    architecture-evolution.md
```

## 🚀 AI-First Design Principles

1. **Discoverability**: Every artifact has clear metadata and location references
2. **Context Preservation**: Rich cross-references between documents and features  
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Accumulated patterns accessible for reuse
4. **Integration Intelligence**: Clear dependency graphs and integration guides
5. **Evolution Tracking**: Historical context for architectural decisions

This knowledge base structure enables AI agents to:
- **Discover** existing components and patterns quickly
- **Reuse** proven architectural decisions and code patterns
- **Integrate** new features with existing system intelligently
- **Evolve** the project while maintaining consistency and quality
