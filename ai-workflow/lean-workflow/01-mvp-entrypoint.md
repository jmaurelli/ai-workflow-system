## AI Agent Instructions

### CRITICAL: Interactive Data Collection Required

**YOU MUST conduct an interactive Q&A session with the user to collect the project initialization data. Do NOT proceed with document generation until you have collected answers to all required questions.**

**Execution Protocol:**
1. **Present each question clearly** to the user one at a time
2. **Wait for the user's response** before proceeding to the next question  
3. **Validate required fields** - do not accept empty responses for required questions
4. **Use defaults** for optional fields if user provides no answer
5. **Store all answers** in a structured format for document generation
6. **Only after collecting all data** should you generate the project-initialization.md file

**Interactive Format:**
- Present questions in a friendly, conversational manner
- Use **numbered references** for easy tracking (human answers: 1., 2., 2a., 2b., etc.)
- Show examples when helpful  
- Confirm user's answers before proceeding
- Allow user to revise previous answers if needed

## Progressive Guided Discovery Framework

**Target Time: 12-15 minutes | Intelligence-driven progressive questioning with reasoning**

### AI Agent Conversation Protocol

**CRITICAL: The AI must use this progressive discovery approach:**

1. **Explain reasoning during questioning** - After each question, provide brief context about why this information helps
2. **Numbered questions** - Use clear numbering for AI questions, numbered responses for human answers (Q: "What's your goal?" ‚Üí Human: "1. Build a web server")
3. **Progressive flow** - Early answers influence later questions and recommendations
4. **Confirmation gates** - Pause after each major section for confirmation and insights
5. **Opt-in follow-ups** - Ask permission before digging deeper with additional questions (max 2 per topic)
6. **Conversational transitions** - Connect sections with explanatory context

## Workflow Integration

### Next Steps After Initialization (Feature-Centric)
Developer: ### Next Steps After Initialization

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

1. **Initialize Feature Directory:**
   - Create date-prefixed feature directory: `/features/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[project-name]/` (auto-generate date from OS, convert `[project-name]` to kebab-case)
   - Initialize `feature-manifest.json` with metadata and workflow tracking
   - Setup directory structure with `artifacts/` subdirectories for generated content

2. **Generate PRD:**
   - Use the collected data to create `./prd.md` within the feature directory
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve the project scope, constraints, and success criteria

3. **Generate SRS (Mandatory - Quality Foundation):**
   - Run `gen-srs.md` to capture critical NFRs for quality MVP development
   - **Focus on MVP essentials**: Performance budgets, security baselines, accessibility foundations
   - Generate `./srs.md` with measurable quality constraints within feature directory
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve performance budgets and quality standards

4. **Design Decisions (Learning-Guided):**
   - Run `gen-design-decisions-lite.md` to make informed technical and UX decisions through interactive questionnaires
   - Generate `./design-decisions.md` with documented rationale and learning insights
   - Update `./learning-notes.md` with personal learning progress
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve technology stack, UX approach, and design decisions

5. **Design Analysis:**
   - Run `gen-design.md` to analyze existing codebase for component reuse and integration opportunities
   - Generate `./design-analysis.md` with implementation guidance within feature directory
   - **Optional:** Run `gen-design-recovery.md` if inconsistencies are detected

6. **Create Tasks:**
   - Use the generated PRD, SRS, design decisions, and design analysis as input to create `./tasks.md`, referencing `gen-tasks-and-testing.md` and following the TDD-Lite approach
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve the task assumptions and success criteria

7. **Update Feature Manifest:**
   - Keep `./feature-manifest.json` up to date with workflow progress and document status

After each substantive action or file update, briefly validate that the intended results were achieved and determine the next step or self-correct if necessary. At major milestones (after PRD and after tasks creation), provide a one to three sentence update summarizing progress, next steps, and any blockers. Attempt a first pass autonomously, but stop and ask for clarification if critical information is missing or approval is explicitly required.

### Human-in-the-Loop Gates (Feature-Centric)
- **Before Feature Directory Creation**: Review and approve feature name and scope for directory naming
- **Before PRD Generation**: Review and approve project scope, constraints, and success criteria  
- **Before SRS Generation**: Review and approve performance budgets and quality standards
- **Before Design Decisions**: Review and approve technology stack, UX approach, and design decisions with documented rationale
- **Before Task Creation**: Review and approve PRD assumptions and success criteria
- **Before Development**: Approve task breakdown and acceptance criteria
- **Scope Changes**: Approve any modifications to project scope or requirements

### Enhanced Feature Directory Initialization Protocol

**CRITICAL: The enhanced feature-manifest.json must capture ALL discovery context to seed subsequent workflow documents.**

```bash
# Auto-generate feature directory with current OS timestamp
FEATURE_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
FEATURE_SLUG="[AI: convert project name to kebab-case]"  
FEATURE_DIR="/features/${FEATURE_DATE}-${FEATURE_SLUG}"

# Create feature directory structure
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/api-contracts"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/design-mockups"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/test-results"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/performance-reports"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/discovery-context"

# Create industry-standard project structure if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p docs/
mkdir -p src/
mkdir -p tests/
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
mkdir -p config/
mkdir -p project-knowledge/architecture/
mkdir -p project-knowledge/business-context/
mkdir -p project-knowledge/developer-knowledge/
mkdir -p project-knowledge/project-evolution/

### AI Agent Instructions for Discovery Context Usage

**CRITICAL: How to use discovery context in subsequent workflow documents:**

1. **PRD Generation**: Reference `discovery_context.user_business_context` and `discovery_context.project_identity`
   - User stories derive from `user_success_journey`
   - Business requirements come from `business_model` and `three_month_success_criteria`
   - Project scope references `project_goal` and `user_pain_point`

2. **SRS Generation**: Reference `discovery_context.technical_context` and `discovery_context.ai_recommendations`
   - Performance budgets based on `three_month_success_criteria` and `hard_constraints`
   - Security requirements from `business_model` and `integration_requirements`
   - Accessibility needs from `user_access_method` and `primary_users`

3. **Design Decisions**: Reference `discovery_context.ai_recommendations` and `discovery_context.technical_context`
   - Technology choices from `recommended_tech_stack` and reasoning
   - Architecture decisions from `architecture_approach`
   - Risk mitigation from `risk_factors`

4. **Tasks Creation**: Reference `discovery_context.workflow_seeding` and `ai_recommendations.development_sequence`
   - Implementation order from `development_sequence`
   - Feature priorities from `user_success_journey`
   - Success criteria from `three_month_success_criteria`

**Context Reference Pattern**: When generating documents, AI should phrase references as:
- "Based on your discovery session, where you identified..."
- "As determined during project initialization, your users..."
- "Given your team context and technical requirements..."

## Notes
- This template consolidates MVP core protocol requirements
- All documentation is kept lean (‚â§ 1 page each) for MVP phase
- External services and containers are opt-in only
- TDD-Lite methodology is mandatory for MVP development
- Conventional commits should reference generated PRD and task documents

## Workflow Transition Protocol

### Document Completion Summary
**AI Instructions**: After completing the MVP project initialization, provide a summary including:
- **Project Name**: [Project name collected]
- **Access Method**: [User access method selected]
- **Primary Users**: [Target user group identified]
- **Technology Direction**: [Preliminary tech stack recommendation based on discovery]
- **Feature Directory Created**: `features/[AI: Insert current date as YYYY-MM-DD]-[kebab-case-project-name]/`
- **Generated Files**: `feature-manifest.json` with discovery context
- **Completion Time**: [AI: Insert current date and time in format: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### User Approval Gate
Present these options to the user:
- **Yes**: "Continue to 02-gen-prd.md to create the Product Requirements Document"
- **No**: "Stop workflow here (you can resume later)"
- **Revise**: "What specifically would you like changed in the project initialization?"

### Next Step Preview
**Next**: [02-gen-prd.md](./02-gen-prd.md) - Product Requirements Document Creation
**Phase 1 Purpose**: Define WHAT we're building (features, scope, goals)
**What PRD needs from this step**: Project identity, user context, technical direction, and discovery data from [feature-manifest.json](./feature-manifest.json)

**üö® CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS:**
**You are now working in `/features/YYYY-MM-DD-project-name/` directory**
**ALL subsequent documents (PRD, SRS, tasks, etc.) must be saved in this feature directory using `./filename.md`**

> **üîó Context Flow:**
> - **Discovery Context** ‚Üí [PRD Functional Requirements](./02-gen-prd.md#functional-requirements)
> - **User Research** ‚Üí [PRD User Stories](./02-gen-prd.md#user-stories) 
> - **Technical Direction** ‚Üí [SRS Technical Constraints](./03-gen-srs.md#technical-constraints)
> - **Business Model** ‚Üí [PRD Success Metrics](./02-gen-prd.md#success-metrics)
