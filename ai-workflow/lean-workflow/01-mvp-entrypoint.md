# MVP Project Entry Point - Step 01 (Foundation Phase)

## Purpose
This document serves as the unified initialization point for MVP projects, automatically generating foundational documentation by collecting essential project data through guided questions. It consolidates the MVP core protocol and project entrypoint requirements into a streamlined workflow.

## ü§ñ Automation Support
This document supports **three automation modes** for AI agents:

### **üö¶ Automation Modes**
- **üö™ GUIDED Mode**: Maximum human oversight - traditional workflow with approval gates
- **‚ö° AUTONOMOUS Mode**: Minimal human oversight - AI agent proceeds automatically with smart safety checks  
- **üß† LEARNING Mode**: Adaptive oversight - learns from approval patterns and reduces gates over time

### **üöÄ Automated Execution**
Use the workflow orchestrators to run this step automatically:

```bash
# Traditional shell orchestrator
./workflow-orchestrator.sh --mode=guided --feature=user-auth

# Intelligent Python orchestrator  
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=autonomous --feature=dashboard

# See execution plan without running
./ai-workflow-runner.py --mode=learning --feature=api-v2 --dry-run
```

See `workflow-sequence-guide.md` for complete automation details.

## AI Agent Instructions

### CRITICAL: Interactive Data Collection Required

**YOU MUST conduct an interactive Q&A session with the user to collect the project initialization data. Do NOT proceed with document generation until you have collected answers to all required questions.**

**Execution Protocol:**
1. **Present each question clearly** to the user one at a time
2. **Wait for the user's response** before proceeding to the next question  
3. **Validate required fields** - do not accept empty responses for required questions
4. **Use defaults** for optional fields if user provides no answer
5. **Store all answers** in a structured format for document generation
6. **Only after collecting all data** should you generate the project-initialization.md file

**Interactive Format:**
- Present questions in a friendly, conversational manner
- Show examples when helpful
- Confirm user's answers before proceeding
- Allow user to revise previous answers if needed

## Workflow Integration

### Next Steps After Initialization (Feature-Centric)
Developer: ### Next Steps After Initialization

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

1. **Initialize Feature Directory:**
   - Create date-prefixed feature directory: `/features/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[project-name]/` (auto-generate date from OS, convert `[project-name]` to kebab-case)
   - Initialize `feature-manifest.json` with metadata and workflow tracking
   - Setup directory structure with `artifacts/` subdirectories for generated content

2. **Generate PRD:**
   - Use the collected data to create `./prd.md` within the feature directory
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve the project scope, constraints, and success criteria

3. **Generate SRS (Mandatory - Quality Foundation):**
   - Run `gen-srs.md` to capture critical NFRs for quality MVP development
   - **Focus on MVP essentials**: Performance budgets, security baselines, accessibility foundations
   - Generate `./srs.md` with measurable quality constraints within feature directory
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve performance budgets and quality standards

4. **Design Decisions (Learning-Guided):**
   - Run `gen-design-decisions-lite.md` to make informed technical and UX decisions through interactive questionnaires
   - Generate `./design-decisions.md` with documented rationale and learning insights
   - Update `./learning-notes.md` with personal learning progress
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve technology stack, UX approach, and design decisions

5. **Design Analysis:**
   - Run `gen-design.md` to analyze existing codebase for component reuse and integration opportunities
   - Generate `./design-analysis.md` with implementation guidance within feature directory
   - **Optional:** Run `gen-design-recovery.md` if inconsistencies are detected

6. **Create Tasks:**
   - Use the generated PRD, SRS, design decisions, and design analysis as input to create `./tasks.md`, referencing `gen-tasks-and-testing.md` and following the TDD-Lite approach
   - **Human Gate:** Review and approve the task assumptions and success criteria

7. **Update Feature Manifest:**
   - Keep `./feature-manifest.json` up to date with workflow progress and document status

After each substantive action or file update, briefly validate that the intended results were achieved and determine the next step or self-correct if necessary. At major milestones (after PRD and after tasks creation), provide a one to three sentence update summarizing progress, next steps, and any blockers. Attempt a first pass autonomously, but stop and ask for clarification if critical information is missing or approval is explicitly required.

### Human-in-the-Loop Gates (Feature-Centric)
- **Before Feature Directory Creation**: Review and approve feature name and scope for directory naming
- **Before PRD Generation**: Review and approve project scope, constraints, and success criteria  
- **Before SRS Generation**: Review and approve performance budgets and quality standards
- **Before Design Decisions**: Review and approve technology stack, UX approach, and design decisions with documented rationale
- **Before Task Creation**: Review and approve PRD assumptions and success criteria
- **Before Development**: Approve task breakdown and acceptance criteria
- **Scope Changes**: Approve any modifications to project scope or requirements

### Feature Directory Initialization Protocol
```bash
# Auto-generate feature directory with OS timestamp
FEATURE_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
FEATURE_SLUG="[convert-project-name-to-kebab-case]"  
FEATURE_DIR="/features/${FEATURE_DATE}-${FEATURE_SLUG}"

# Create feature directory structure
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/api-contracts"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/design-mockups"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/test-results"
mkdir -p "${FEATURE_DIR}/artifacts/performance-reports"

# Initialize feature manifest
cat > "${FEATURE_DIR}/feature-manifest.json" << 'EOF'
{
  "feature_metadata": {
    "feature_name": "[Collected Project Name]",
    "feature_slug": "[kebab-case-slug]",
    "feature_directory": "[YYYY-MM-DD]-[kebab-case-slug]",
    "creation_date": "[ISO-8601-timestamp]",
    "creator": "mvp-entrypoint-workflow",
    "project_context": "[Collected project context]"
  },
  "workflow_status": {
    "current_phase": "initialization",
    "phases_completed": [],
    "phases_remaining": ["foundation", "design_analysis", "implementation", "completion_summary"],
    "estimated_completion": null,
    "last_updated": "[ISO-8601-timestamp]"
  },
  "document_status": {
    "prd": {"status": "pending", "path": "./prd.md"},
    "srs": {"status": "pending", "path": "./srs.md"},
    "design_decisions": {"status": "pending", "path": "./design-decisions.md"},
    "design_analysis": {"status": "pending", "path": "./design-analysis.md"},
    "tasks": {"status": "pending", "path": "./tasks.md"},
    "learning_notes": {"status": "pending", "path": "./learning-notes.md"},
    "completion_summary": {"status": "pending", "path": "./completion-summary.md"}
  }
}
EOF

# Set working directory for all subsequent workflow steps
cd "${FEATURE_DIR}"
```

## Notes
- This template consolidates MVP core protocol requirements
- All documentation is kept lean (‚â§ 1 page each) for MVP phase
- External services and containers are opt-in only
- TDD-Lite methodology is mandatory for MVP development
- Conventional commits should reference generated PRD and task documents
