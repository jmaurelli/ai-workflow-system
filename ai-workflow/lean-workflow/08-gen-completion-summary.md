# Workflow: Generate Feature Completion Summary (Executive Report)

## Objective
Generate a concise executive summary with full traceability that captures key achievements, decisions, and outcomes from a completed feature implementation, providing human-readable insights with direct links to supporting documentation.

---

## When to Use
- **After feature implementation completion**: All tasks marked complete in `./tasks.md`
- **Before feature archival**: Moving feature to project history
- **For stakeholder reporting**: Creating executive visibility into development outcomes
- **For learning capture**: Documenting lessons learned and capability development

---

## Quickstart (Executive Summary Generation)
- **Auto-detect feature context**: Read `./feature-manifest.json` for feature metadata and completion status
- **Gather completion data**: Read all feature documents (PRD, SRS, tasks, design decisions, learning notes)
- **Generate traceability report**: Create executive summary with links to supporting evidence
- **Save as**: `./completion-summary.md` within feature directory
- **Update manifest**: Mark completion summary as generated in `./feature-manifest.json`

---

## Workflow (Executive Summary Generation)

1. **Validate Feature Completion:**
   - Read `./feature-manifest.json` to confirm all workflow phases completed
   - Verify all tasks marked as complete in `./tasks.md`
   - Check that all quality gates passed and success criteria met

2. **Gather Achievement Data:**
   - Extract key achievements from `./prd.md` goals and requirements
   - Extract performance results from `./srs.md` NFR validation
   - Extract implementation outcomes from `./tasks.md` completion status
   - Extract learning outcomes from `./learning-notes.md`

3. **Analyze Decision Impact:**
   - Review technology decisions from `./design-decisions.md`
   - Assess component reuse decisions from `./design-analysis.md`
   - Evaluate architectural choices and their effectiveness

4. **Generate Executive Summary:**
   - Create 1-page executive report with traceability links
   - Focus on business value, technical achievements, and learning outcomes
   - Include specific metrics and validation results with evidence links

5. **Update Feature Manifest:**
   - Mark completion summary as generated
   - Set feature status to "completed"
   - Record final completion timestamp

## AI Agent Directives (Executive Summary Generation)

### **Completion Validation (Priority 1)**
- **Read feature manifest**: Validate that `./feature-manifest.json` shows all phases completed
- **Verify task completion**: Confirm all tasks in `./tasks.md` are marked as `[x] completed`
- **Check quality gates**: Ensure all acceptance criteria and quality gates passed
- **Validate artifacts**: Confirm expected artifacts exist in `./artifacts/` subdirectories

### **Data Gathering (Priority 2)**
- **Extract achievements**: Parse `./prd.md` for goals and requirements, cross-reference with completed tasks
- **Gather metrics**: Extract performance results, test coverage, security validation from various documents
- **Collect decisions**: Summarize key technology and architecture decisions with impact assessment
- **Capture learning**: Synthesize capability development and lessons learned from implementation

### **Traceability Generation (Priority 3)**
- **Create evidence links**: Generate specific section links to supporting documentation for every claim
- **Validate link accuracy**: Ensure all links point to actual content that supports the stated achievement
- **Cross-reference requirements**: Map achievements back to original PRD requirements and SRS NFRs
- **Document artifact locations**: Include links to generated artifacts and supporting materials

### **Executive Summary Rules**
- **Keep to 1 page**: Focus on key achievements, decisions, and outcomes with evidence links
- **Use active voice**: "Achieved X" not "X was achieved" 
- **Include metrics**: Specific, measurable results with supporting evidence
- **Link everything**: Every achievement, decision, and outcome must have traceability link
- **Focus on value**: Emphasize business value, learning, and future applicability

### **Feature Manifest Update**
- **Mark completion summary as generated**: Update `./feature-manifest.json` document status
- **Set feature status to completed**: Update workflow status to indicate full completion
- **Record final timestamps**: Update completion time and last modified timestamps
- **Validate manifest consistency**: Ensure all document statuses align with actual file existence

### **Quality Validation**
- **Verify all links work**: Test that every traceability link points to existing content
- **Validate achievement claims**: Cross-check that claimed achievements are supported by evidence
- **Check metric accuracy**: Ensure reported metrics match source documentation
- **Confirm artifact existence**: Validate that referenced artifacts actually exist

Set reasoning_effort = high; executive summaries require accuracy and comprehensive validation.

## Human Review Gate (Required)

### **Pre-Generation Validation**
- Confirm: All feature work is actually complete and meets success criteria
- Confirm: All supporting documents exist and contain expected content
- Confirm: Quality gates passed and acceptance criteria met

### **Post-Generation Review**
- Confirm: Summary accurately reflects actual achievements and outcomes
- Confirm: All traceability links work and support stated claims
- Confirm: Technology decisions and lessons learned are accurately captured
- Confirm: Business value and impact are clearly articulated

### **Approval for Archival**
- Approve: Feature can be moved to project history or marked as completed
- Approve: Summary provides sufficient context for future reference
- Approve: All artifacts and documentation are preserved appropriately

---

## Handoff + Memory Sync

Update agent memory with completion summary context:

```json
{
  "stage": "completion_summary",
  "feature_slug": "[feature-name]",
  "feature_directory": "/features/[date]-[slug]/",
  "completion_summary_path": "./completion-summary.md",
  "completion_date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
  "overall_success": "[Success/Partial/Issues]",
  "key_achievements": ["achievement1", "achievement2", "achievement3"],
  "technology_decisions": {
    "backend": "[technology choice]",
    "frontend": "[technology choice]",
    "architecture": "[pattern choice]"
  },
  "performance_results": {
    "response_times": "[achieved vs target]",
    "test_coverage": "[percentage achieved]",
    "quality_gates": "[pass/fail status]"
  },
  "learning_outcomes": {
    "skills_developed": ["skill1", "skill2"],
    "confidence_growth": "before‚Üíafter",
    "patterns_learned": ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
  },
  "recommendations": {
    "architecture": "[recommendation]",
    "technology": "[recommendation]",
    "process": "[recommendation]"
  },
  "artifacts_generated": ["api-docs", "design-assets", "test-results", "performance-reports"]
}
```

### **Context Seed (for Project History)**
Provide this summary data for quarterly rollup generation:

```json
{
  "feature_completion": {
    "feature_name": "[feature-name]",
    "completion_date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
    "success_level": "[Success/Partial/Issues]",
    "business_value": "[key business impact]",
    "technology_evolution": "[key technology decisions]",
    "learning_contribution": "[key capability development]",
    "summary_path": "/features/[date]-[slug]/completion-summary.md"
  }
}
```

This completion summary workflow ensures that every feature generates valuable, traceable insights that contribute to organizational learning and project history!

## Workflow Transition Protocol

### Document Completion Summary
**AI Instructions**: After completing the completion summary, provide a summary including:
- **Executive Summary Generated**: `./completion-summary.md` with traceability links
- **Achievements Captured**: [Number of key achievements documented]
- **Technology Decisions**: [Major technology and architecture decisions summarized]
- **Learning Outcomes**: [Skills developed and capability growth documented]
- **Business Value**: [Quantified impact and value delivered]
- **Manifest Updated**: feature-manifest.json marked completion summary as completed
- **Completion Time**: [AI: Insert current date and time in format: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### User Approval Gate
Present these options to the user:
- **Yes**: "Continue to 09-gen-project-history.md for learning capture"
- **No**: "Stop workflow here (you can resume later)"
- **Revise**: "What specifically would you like changed in the completion summary?"

### Next Step Preview
**Next**: 09-gen-project-history.md - Project History and Learning Capture
**Phase 4 Purpose**: Capture organizational learning (quarterly rollups)
**What Project History needs from this step**: Completion summary, lessons learned, and technology evolution insights
