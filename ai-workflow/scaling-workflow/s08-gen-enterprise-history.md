## Enterprise History Workflow

### **1. Identify Completed Enterprise Features**
```bash
# Auto-scan for completed enterprise features
find /enterprise-features -name "feature-manifest.json" -exec grep -l '"current_phase": "enterprise_completed"' {} \; | \
while read manifest; do
  FEATURE_DIR=$(dirname "$manifest")
  FEATURE_NAME=$(jq -r '.feature_metadata.feature_name' "$manifest")
  ENTERPRISE_SCOPE=$(jq -r '.feature_metadata.enterprise_scope' "$manifest")
  echo "Completed enterprise feature: $FEATURE_NAME (Scope: $ENTERPRISE_SCOPE) at $FEATURE_DIR"
done
```

### **2. Archive Completed Enterprise Features**
```bash
# Move completed enterprise features to history
QUARTER="2024-q1"
mkdir -p "/enterprise-history/archived-enterprise-features"

# Move each completed enterprise feature directory
for feature_dir in /enterprise-features/*; do
  if [[ -f "$feature_dir/feature-manifest.json" ]]; then
    STATUS=$(jq -r '.workflow_status.current_phase' "$feature_dir/feature-manifest.json")
    if [[ "$STATUS" == "enterprise_completed" ]]; then
      mv "$feature_dir" "/enterprise-history/archived-enterprise-features/"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### **3. Generate Enterprise Quarterly Summary**
- **Read all enterprise completion summaries**: Extract architectural evolution, compliance achievements, design system progress
- **Aggregate enterprise achievements**: Combine microservices maturity, design system adoption, security compliance, scaling capability
- **Analyze architectural patterns**: Identify successful enterprise patterns, technology evolution, organizational scaling insights
- **Generate strategic rollup documents**: Create comprehensive quarterly summary with enterprise strategic recommendations
