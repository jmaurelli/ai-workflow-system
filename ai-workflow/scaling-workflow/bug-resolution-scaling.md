# Workflow: Bug Resolution (Enterprise Scaling & Multi-Team Coordination)

## Objective
Resolve bugs efficiently in enterprise-scale distributed systems through systematic enterprise context discovery, multi-team coordination, and comprehensive architectural validation. Reduce enterprise bug resolution cycles from 4-5 iterations to 1-2 iterations by leveraging established enterprise architecture, design system governance, and compliance requirements.

---

## When to Use
- **Enterprise production bugs** affecting distributed systems or multiple services
- **Multi-team coordination bugs** requiring cross-service investigation
- **Compliance-related bugs** affecting security, accessibility, or regulatory requirements
- **Design system inconsistencies** across federated component libraries
- **Performance regressions** violating enterprise SLA commitments
- **Integration failures** between microservices or external enterprise systems

---

## Enterprise Bug Resolution Strategy

### **Enterprise Context Reuse First**
Your enterprise scaling workflow succeeds because AI agents get rich, explicit enterprise context. Bug resolution should leverage the **same enterprise context patterns** from:
- **Enterprise Architecture Decisions**: Microservices boundaries, service mesh configuration, distributed system patterns
- **Design System Governance**: Component library standards, design token architecture, cross-platform consistency
- **Enterprise SRS Requirements**: Performance budgets, security compliance, availability targets, integration constraints
- **Multi-Team Coordination**: Team assignments, approval gates, cross-service dependencies, stakeholder coordination

---

## Quick Start (Enterprise Bug Resolution)

### **Simple Enterprise Invocation**
When you encounter a bug during enterprise development and testing:

```
I found a bug in our enterprise system. Please use the enterprise bug resolution 
workflow in ai-workflow/scaling-workflow/bug-resolution-scaling.md.

The bug: [Brief description]
Affected services: [Microservice names]
Enterprise context directory: [/enterprise-features/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/]
```

### **Auto-Discovery Enterprise Invocation (Recommended)**
```
I found a bug during enterprise testing. Please run enterprise bug resolution 
with automatic context discovery.

The bug: [Brief description]
Let the workflow find the relevant enterprise context automatically.
```

---

## Guided Enterprise Bug Discovery

### **1. Enterprise Recent Task Analysis (Automatic Context Discovery)**

**AI Agent Instructions**: Automatically discover and analyze enterprise context:

```bash
# Find most recent enterprise feature directory
LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE=$(find /enterprise-features -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "20*" | sort -r | head -1)

# Extract enterprise context from feature manifest
if [[ -f "$LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE/feature-manifest.json" ]]; then
  echo "Enterprise Context Discovery:"
  echo "- Feature: $(jq -r '.feature_metadata.feature_name' $LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE/feature-manifest.json)"
  echo "- Teams: $(jq -r '.feature_metadata.stakeholder_groups[]' $LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE/feature-manifest.json | tr '\n' ', ')"
  echo "- Architecture Tier: $(jq -r '.enterprise_context.architecture_tier' $LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE/feature-manifest.json)"
  echo "- Compliance: $(jq -r '.enterprise_context.compliance_requirements[]' $LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE/feature-manifest.json | tr '\n' ', ')"
fi

# Find most recently modified enterprise tasks
find $LATEST_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE -name "tasks.md" -exec ls -la {} \;
```

**What was recently implemented in the enterprise system?**
- Read `./tasks.md` in the latest enterprise feature directory
- Look for tasks marked as completed in the last 1-2 weeks
- Identify which microservices, components, or integrations were recently changed
- Note any enterprise NFR validations or compliance testing completed

### **2. Progressive Enterprise Bug Exploration (Learning-Guided)**

**Enterprise Context Questions** (AI agent asks these systematically):

#### **A. Enterprise System Context**
"Let me understand the enterprise system context first:"

1. **Which enterprise services are affected?**
   - "Is this affecting a specific microservice, or multiple services?"
   - "Are there any service mesh communication errors or distributed tracing anomalies?"
   - "Do you see any correlation with recent service deployments or configuration changes?"

2. **What enterprise components are involved?**
   - "Are you seeing issues with design system components, or custom implementations?"
   - "Is this affecting the component library, design tokens, or both?"
   - "Are multiple teams reporting similar issues with shared components?"

3. **Enterprise architecture impact:**
   - "Are there any API gateway errors, service discovery issues, or load balancer problems?"
   - "Is this affecting our event streaming, database clusters, or caching layers?"
   - "Do you see any patterns in our monitoring dashboards or alerting systems?"

#### **B. Enterprise Bug Context Discovery**
"Now let me gather specific bug details with enterprise context:"

1. **How are you testing when the bug occurs?**
   - "Are you testing through the API gateway, direct service calls, or end-to-end flows?"
   - "Is this happening in development, staging, or production environments?"
   - "Are you using our standard enterprise testing datasets or custom data?"

2. **Enterprise environment specifics:**
   - "Which Kubernetes namespace and cluster are you testing in?"
   - "Are you testing with our standard enterprise authentication (SSO/OAuth) or bypassing it?"
   - "Is this affecting all users, specific enterprise tenants, or certain user roles?"

3. **Enterprise compliance context:**
   - "Does this affect any of our compliance controls (SOC2, GDPR, PCI)?"
   - "Are there any audit trail or security logging implications?"
   - "Could this impact our enterprise SLA commitments or availability targets?"

#### **C. Enterprise Multi-Team Coordination**
"Let me check if this requires enterprise team coordination:"

1. **Cross-team impact assessment:**
   - "Does this affect other teams' services or shared infrastructure?"
   - "Should we involve the platform team, security team, or design system team?"
   - "Are there any enterprise architecture review board implications?"

2. **Enterprise communication needs:**
   - "Do we need to notify stakeholders about enterprise SLA impact?"
   - "Should this trigger our enterprise incident response procedures?"
   - "Are there any customer-facing or compliance reporting implications?"

### **3. Enterprise Context Integration**
