# Enterprise Task Completion Feedback System (Scaling)

## Objective
Capture enterprise-level implementation insights from task completion to improve future architectural decisions, design system governance, context distillation effectiveness, and team coordination. Build organizational learning loops that make each enterprise project more successful.

---

## When to Use
- **After completing each enterprise parent task** - capture architectural and coordination insights
- **After major service deployments** - comprehensive system performance and integration feedback
- **Before scaling decisions** - review enterprise lessons learned for better architectural choices
- **Quarterly architecture reviews** - aggregate feedback for enterprise workflow and standard improvements
